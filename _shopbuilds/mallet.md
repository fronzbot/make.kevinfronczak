A while ago I purchased some small Bloodwood samples since I thought they looked neat and figured I could make something with them.  They have since been sitting undisturbed in my [lumber rack](/shopbuilds/lumber_cart).  Finally, I had the urge to use them for something so I decided to build a Joiner's Mallet.  I figured that since Bloodwood is incredibly dense, it would give the mallet some nice heft.  I decided to also make use of some maple scrap I had, but didn't have enough for a handle so opted for a Red Oak handle, since I had much more of that particular wood.

I didn't have a full slab of maple, so I had to edge glue three pieces to match the dimensions of the Bloodwood head. I cut the pieces to rough sizes and oriented them to see what the final product might look like.

Once I was happy with my layout, I cut the glued maple piece in half.  My thought process here was that I could trim my oak handle (at least the part that's embedded in the head) to the same width as the maple, so everything would be perfectly sandwiched.

<div class="img_row">

    <img class="col one" src="/img/mallet/handle_raw.jpg"/>

</div>

I then dry fit everything to make sure my dimensions were correct.

</div>

In order to ensure a snug fit, I cut some grooves in the top of the oak handle and carved some maple wedges.  This allows the oak handle to expand into the head, so that there is a nice tight fit.

Everything was finally glued up and I could sand the whole mallet to 220 grit.  I also took a round-over bit to the handle to make it a bit more smooth, but it still has a mostly rectangular shape to correctly fit the contours of my hand (lightly touch your index and thumb together- note that it is probably not circular, and is closer to rectangular).

To finish it, I decided to use some Watco Danish Oil, without any stain.  It's **incredible** how much the Bloodwood pops after applying the oil.  Granted, the deep red color won't last over time (it will gradually fade to reddish brown).

</div>

I'm really happy with how this turned out, though.  It's *very* heavy for the size, which is perfect. Although, I'm not sure I'll ever really want to smack anything with it, it might end up being more of a "show piece"!
