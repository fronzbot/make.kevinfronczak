One issue I've been running into is the need to joint two boards (make them perfectly flat and square to one face), specifically for panel glue-ups.  So I made this jig for my table saw.  The design allows me to taper, as well as joint, so it is quite versatile (plus, it's easy to build!).

To start, I needed some rails for my table saw miter slots.  Luckily, when I build my [crosscut sled](/shopbuilds/crosscut_sled) I cut a few extra rails out of plywood, just in case I would need them again.  These rails fit perfectly in my miter slot, and by using plywood I can avoid concerns over wood expansion that would otherwise exist with hardwood rails.

Next, I needed to use my router table to route some slots so I could thread a bolt through for the fence.  I used a 1/4" spiral up-cut bit for this, and then a 1/2" mortising bit to cut some wider channels for the head of the bolt (on the underside of the jig).

Here's a brief video showing my first test cut (jointing two 2x4s).
