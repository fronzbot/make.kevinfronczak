I've been wanting to build a shop stool for awhile and, as luck would have it, [Steve Ramsey](https://www.youtube.com/user/stevemarin) posted a [video on a shop stool build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w3DGnX94zk) a few weeks ago and included some [free plans on his site](https://woodworking.formeremortals.net/2018/05/basic-shop-stool/) so I decided to tackle the project.

I didn't have to purchase any lumber for this project as I was able to use cutoffs from previous projects.  The 2x4s I had for the frame were... not the best and had some decent bowing to them.  Since this was a stool for my shop, and not a furniture piece, I decided to continue with the wood anyways.  At one point I ran into a bit of a problem when some tension in the wood released and began to pinch.  Luckily, my table saw has a riving knife so I didn't get into any dangerous situation, but my heart definitely skipped a beat.

After cutting the frame out, I realized I had made a pretty dumb mistake.  When measuring the depth of the dado for the lap joint, I registered to the wrong side on my cross braces.  Normally this wouldn't be a problem because the braces should be square... but mine were not.  One side was about 1/4" shorter than the other which caused those pieces to sit a bit too deep in the dado.  This is OK from a structural point of view, it's just not as visually appealing.  Here is the dry-fit:

The next step was to cut out the top brace that the stool seat will be glued to.  This was pretty easy to do, and luckily I had a good amount of clamps to glue everything together.  This was particularly important since, as I mentioned earlier, the 2x4s I used had a bit of a bow to them.  So these joints needed a little...persuasion to stay in place.  The clamping pressure helped to keep everything as square as possible despite the warped wood.

The stool seat was made from some pine 1x4s I had.  I oriented the boards with alternating grain patterns to help keep a flat board even with seasonal wood movement due to moisture content.

The seat had a little bow to it primarily due to me not bothering jointing the edges of the boards.  Again, because this was a shop project, I didn't particularly care, **but** it did take a bit of elbow grease to glue this sucker down.  I also drove a few screws in from the bottom to help hold it in place.

And after everything was glued up:

I then applied some polyurethane to give the stool a little protection.  I used poly because I was actually in the process of using it on a different project and so it was easily available.
