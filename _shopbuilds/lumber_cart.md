Having large wood cutoffs and random plywood laying all over my shop was not only annoying, but dangerous (trip hazard).  So I decided to build a rolling lumber cart.  I wanted to build this out of one sheet of plywood, which I managed to do.  It's a very rough construction as I built it in a sort of stream-of-consciousness, but it turned out alright.  It certainly serves its purpose.
