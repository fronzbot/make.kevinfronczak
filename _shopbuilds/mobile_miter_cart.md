I was getting sick of not having a good spot for my miter saw (and also having to constantly screw in extensions so I can clamp stop blocks to them for long cuts) so I decided to build a dedicated cart.  You can find [free plans for this cart here](/plans/miter_cart).

The idea here is I wanted to be able to collapse the cart down for storage purposes, but be able to expand it to cut long lengths.  This meant hinged "wings" that, when extended, were level with the surface of the miter saw.

On the wings, I added a measuring tape with adhesive back, so I could very quickly make rough cuts without busting out an actual measuring tape.
