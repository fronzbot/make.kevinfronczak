This workbench was the first project in the [Weekend Woodworker](https://theweekendwoodworker.com) course by [Steve Ramsey](https://www.youtube.com/user/stevinmarin/featured).  He has free plans for this workbench on his website, [Woodworking For Mere Mortals](https://woodworking.formeremortals.net).  This bench is very simple to build, with a roughly 2'x4' work surface and has locking casters to allow for easy movement.  The mobile nature of the bench ended up being a theme in my workshop after this build, since the ability to move tools around to adapt to whatever I'm working on has been incredibly helpful.

These plans are available for free thanks to Steve Ramsey, and can be found [here](https://basicmobileworkbench.com)!

This marked the first project that involved the use of something *other* than a circular saw.  I purchased a relatively inexpensive 10" Ryobi miter saw for this project (and, ultimately, as required by the rest of the woodworking course).  I'm very much of the opinion that your first tool purchase should be an inexpensive one (not cheap, but not top-of-the-line either).  That way you can figure out a few things:

- How much do you use the tool?
- What do you like/dislike about the tool?
- How much more efficient does the tool make you?

If you don't use the tool a lot and/or it doesn't make you more efficient, buying an expensive version is a complete waste of money.  Even if you use it a lot, imagine buying a very expensive tool only to realize you really hate x, y, and z, things about it... that a different brand/version solves.  Understanding what you like/dislike about something before buying your "final" model is something I strongly believe in.  One argument against this is that you tend to keep the cheaper model for too long, but quite frankly: if it gets the job done and doesn't "get in the way" of my work... does it really matter?
