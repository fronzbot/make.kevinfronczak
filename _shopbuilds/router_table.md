I had a really old trim router table from my dad that was starting to become annoying to use.  Simple roundover and chamfer bits just would not fit, so I was limited to straight bits only which was frustrating.  So I decided to build my own router table, with a fence inspired by [Steve Ramsey](http://woodworking.formeremortals.net).

The construction was pretty simple.  I laminated a 1/2" MDF board to a 1/4" sheet of whiteboard... board.  I wanted to use melamine, but my local home center didn't have any sheets (that I could find at least).  Anyways, this laminated set of boards served as my router table top as well as my split fence.  I used my router to carve out a channel for the t-track in the fence, and the miter track in the table.

I installed a vacuum port on the fence and used some oak I had as side clamps.

The router was just screwed directly to the table.  I can still remove the router to utilize the plunge function without unscrewing anything, and the sleeve that's screwed into the table top has a height adjustment screw built it, making it perfect to use for this application.  I also added a switch for easy on/off capability.

The table itself was built on a very simple rolling stand with a small drawer to hold router bits.
