After getting my table saw and experience the annoyance of an imperfect miter gauge, I decided to build a crosscut sled by (mostly) following William Ng's [Five Cut Method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbG-n--LFgQ).  I was able to reduce my error to about two thousandths of an inch over around a twelve inch length, which was miles better than where I was sans sled.  I used maple for the runners, but they were *not* quartersawn, and I'm currenly experiencing a bit of tightness due to mild warping so I may replace them with something more dimensionally stable, like plywood.
