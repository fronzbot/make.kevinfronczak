Welcome to my shop!

**Who**

My name is Kevin Fronczak.  My full-time job is in the semiconductor industry designing really tiny electronic circuits built on silicon crystals, and I have a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering that helped jump-start this career.  I've got a [personal page](https://kevinfronczak.com) you can check out if you're interested in learning more about my day-job. 

Now, what does this have to do with woodworking?  Well...not much, really.  Woodworking started out as a hobby of mine, allowing me to escape the computer screen and build something with my hands.  Plus, I find woodworking to be a very relaxing experience, allowing me to decompress after long engineering sessions at work where my mind starts to feel like Jell-O.

**Why**

I was first exposed to woodworking as a child.  Both my grandfather and father would build things, allowing me to "supervise" or, occasionally, even help out!  Over time, other activities took over my dad's life and I lost some interest in the hobby, turning my attention to other things.  Time passed, and eventually my wife was pregnant with our first child and my first instinct was that I wanted to build something for her [which you can see here!](/portfolio/cube_bookcase).  From there, I was re-addicted to the hobby, and started learning a lot of skills with the help of some awesome youtubers such as [Steve Ramsey](https://woodworking.formeremortals.net), [Marc Spagnuolo](https://thewoodwhisperer.com), [Jay Bates](https://jayscustomcreations.com), [Paul Sellers](https://paulsellers.com), and a bunch of others.

**What**

I definitely have a focus on building furniture.  It's something I really enjoy and really makes me feel proud when I walk into a room furnished with items I built from scratch.  Also, building fixtures for my shop that help with organization or efficiency is something I do a lot of as well.  Many times, I use shop projects as exercises for more complex furniture (if I screw up a shop project, it's usually not a big deal.  Screwing up an expensive piece of furniture, however... well, that's annoying to put it lightly).

**Where**

I live in Penfield, NY which is a suburb of Rochester, NY.  I originally grew up outside of Buffalo, NY and so am a Western New Yorker, born and bred for sure.  Obviously, you can follow any of my work on this website, but I also like to post things on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/kevin_fronczak) so please feel free to follow me!
