This is the exact same design as the [Entry Bench](/portfolio/entry_bench) I built earlier in the year.  My sister, who is getting married later this year, mentioned how it would look good in her house so I decided to build her one as a wedding gift for her bridal shower.  I took a lot of lessons I learned from the previous build and applied them here, and I'm much happier with this version that my original one.

One of the most important lessons I learned last time around was how difficult it was to apply stain and finish in between the horizontal slats.  So for this build, I cut all the pieces I needed and sanded them _prior to assembly_.  This allowed me to stain and finish the inner pieces first, to ensure even coverage on all parts of the bench.  I opted to use Minwax's Early American stain and used a wipe-on varnish for the finish, that I mixed myself.  For the wipe-on varnish, I used a high-gloss polyurethane that I thinned with mineral spirits.  The first few coats were thinned to a 50/50 mix, and the final coats were closer to 80/20.  I applied around 8 coats in total, which is probably equivalent to around 2 or 3 brushed-on coats.

I allowed the finish to cure overnight before assembling the full bench.  I made sure to _not_ finish the outside (easy-to-access) parts since I'd want to sand any imperfections flush (of which there were a few small ones).  I used screws on the inner pieces just to act as clamps as I glued more pieces together during assembly.  I clamped the full bench and let it dry overnight.

One additional touch I added was to heat transfer a print to personal the piece for my sister and her soon-to-be-husband.  This process is relatively straight-forward if you have access to a laser printer.  I just create some print/pattern in a text-editing program and reverse the pattern prior to printing.  I then tape this reversed pattern face-down on the workpiece and use an inexpensive wood burning tool (with a flat transfer head) to transfer the toner to the wood.  It turns out really nice, but you have to be careful not to apply too much heat, or you'll burn the wood (which we'll see in a moment).

![Stained bench](/img/harmony_bench/stained.jpg "Stained bench"){: .col .three .center}
After staining the bench, we can see the issue caused by too much heat with the toner transfer: the slight burning is highlighted by the stain.  Now, I could have avoided this by using a dye-stain rather than a pigment-based stain.  Dye stains will tend to color the wood evenly, whereas the pigmented stains highlight differences in the wood.  The Early American stain is a pigment-based stain, so unfortunately I boxed myself into a corner here.  You know how people tell you to test on a piece of scrap first... yeah, you should do that.  Regardless, it's a minor imperfection, but a frustrating one for sure.

The final step in finishing the bench was to knock the glossy finish down to a satin.  I do this in the same way that I buff lacquer: lightly sand with 320 grit to evenly knock the gloss down.  Then I use 0000 steel wool with soapy water as a lubricant to bring the finish back up to a satin.
