A while ago I purchased some small Bloodwood samples since I thought they looked neat and figured I could make something with them.  They have since been sitting undisturbed in my [lumber rack](/shopbuilds/lumber_cart).  Finally, I had the urge to use them for something so I decided to build a Joiner's Mallet.  I figured that since Bloodwood is incredibly dense, it would give the mallet some nice heft.  I decided to also make use of some maple scrap I had, but didn't have enough for a handle so opted for a Red Oak handle, since I had much more of that particular wood.

I didn't have a full slab of maple, so I had to edge glue three pieces to match the dimensions of the Bloodwood head. I cut the pieces to rough sizes and oriented them to see what the final product might look like.

Once I was happy with my layout, I cut the glued maple piece in half.  My thought process here was that I could trim my oak handle (at least the part that's embedded in the head) to the same width as the maple, so everything would be perfectly sandwiched.

I then dry fit everything to make sure my dimensions were correct.

In order to ensure a snug fit, I cut some grooves in the top of the oak handle and carved some maple wedges.  This allows the oak handle to expand into the head, so that there is a nice tight fit.

Everything was finally glued up and I could sand the whole mallet to 220 grit.  I also took a round-over bit to the handle to make it a bit more smooth, but it still has a mostly rectangular shape to correctly fit the contours of my hand (lightly touch your index and thumb together- note that it is probably not circular, and is closer to rectangular).

To finish it, I decided to use some Watco Danish Oil, without any stain.  It's **incredible** how much the Bloodwood pops after applying the oil.  Granted, the deep red color won't last over time (it will gradually fade to reddish brown).

I'm really happy with how this turned out, though.  It's *very* heavy for the size, which is perfect. Although, I'm not sure I'll ever really want to smack anything with it, it might end up being more of a "show piece"!
