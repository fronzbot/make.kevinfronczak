I built this bookcase for my daughter who was actually born about two weeks after I completed it.  My wife wanted a bookcase in the nursery and wanted it to be white, as it would work well with the colors in the room.  So, I went with a very simple [Ana White](https://www.ana-white.com) design since I was still new to woodworking and the basic pocket-hole screw and plywood style was not intimidating.  Similar to my [Simple Nightstand](/portfolio/nightstand), my only power tool was a circular saw (well, and a drill) so my cuts were imperfect at best.

The frame and inserts were made out of 3/4" plywood, and framed with 1x2 pine boards.

I sanded down to 220 grit, and then finished with a few coats of white paint.  We bought some fabric cubbies to place inside.  The whole piece is actually really solid, and given its mostly plywood construction, is quite dimensionally stable.

This project was the last Ana White design I ever used, as I was comfortable with the very basic skills I developed.
