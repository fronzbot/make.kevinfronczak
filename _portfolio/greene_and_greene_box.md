I was asked to build a wedding card box for my sister's wedding, so I decided to overcomplicate it.  I have been fascinated by Greene and Greene style furniture and figured that it would be a really fun and challenging idea to design and build a wedding card box in that iconic style.  I have some [free plans](/plans/greene_and_greene_box) available for those who may be interested in tackling this project.

### Milling Lumber
------------------

To start, I chose Sapele for my box material and Wenge as the square plugs.  Traditionally, the Greene brothers used Ebony for their plugs but Ebony is *so damn expensive* so I went with the cheaper (yet still pricey) Wenge.  I first roughly marked out my cuts using some chalk so I could more easily visualize the different grain patterns and how they may look with the assembled piece.  I bought almost exactly the board-footage of wood I needed for the project, so taking my time here was important.

### Panels and Finger Joints
-----------------------------

![Gluing panels](/img/keepsake_box/panel_glueup.jpg "Gluing panels for walls"){: .col .half .left}

Since I needed to glue up panels for the walls of the box, I wanted to make sure the edges of my board were square.  I don't have a jointer, so to do this I used my previously built [table saw jointing jig](/shopbuilds/tapering_jig).  I first jointed one edge and then used this edge to register against my table saw fence for the rip cuts.  When I was finished with that, I began the glue-up of the wall panels.

The next day, I removed the clamps from the panels and cleaned them up with my Smoothing Plane and a card scraper.  Sapele has some tight interlocked grain which makes it *very* difficult to avoid tearout while planing...which I learned the hard way.  Luckily most of the tearout I had was pretty shallow and easily cleaned up with the card scraper.  Any deep gouges I had ended up being used as the inside of the box, so no one really sees it...

Before moving onto cutting the finger joints, I needed to trim the wall panels to their final dimensions.  To do this, I used my previously built [crosscut sled](/shopbuilds/crosscut_sled).  I am using a 40-tooth thin-kerf general purpose blade here, which gives me a very clean cut.

I really didn't feel like installing a dado stack for the finger joints, so I just hogged out material one kerf at a time.  The way I designed this box allowed me to setup one stop on my miter gauge's sacrificial fence.  I first carefully align the start of the cut by eye, and make my cut.  I then move the piece to the stop block and make a second cut.  After that, I simply move the piece horizontally until I've taken all of the material out.  Once the first finger joint dado is cut, I flip the panel and do the second dado.

![Box joints dry fit](/img/keepsake_box/finger_joint_dry_fit.jpg "Dry fit of finger joints"){: .col .half .right}

Once the front and back panels are finished, I have to carefully mark these joints on the side panels.  I then cut these joints in a similar fashion to the front and rear panels.  The dry fit ended up being a tad looser than I would've liked, but there were no visual gaps.  As a note, each finger is proud of the surface by around 1/8" so that I can round them a bit.  This type of styling is an iconic part of Greene & Greene furniture.

### Waterfall Lifts
------------------

The next step was to cut the waterfall lifts in the bottom of the panels.  This little design element helps make the box stand out a bit and, like the proud finger joints, is another nice Greene & Greene motif.  The process here is rather straight-forward.  Like the finger joints, I couldn't be bothered to install my dado stack so I just used my normal thin-kerf blade to hog out material.  I didn't have to be perfect here, so I just eye-balled the start and stop points of the "steps".

To shape the lifts, I eve-balled an angle that looked nice to me and used my sliding bevel gauge to lock that angle in.  I transferred this angle to each of the steps on every panel.  To cut these angles, I just used my dovetail saw and cleaned it up a bit with my card scraper.  
The next step was to shape the lifts to give them a soft roundover profile.  I did most of the shaping with a coarse rasp and followed it with some 220 and 320 grit sandpaper.  It's worth pointing out that the 320 grit sandpaper I used was a flexible material made by 3M that I found at Home Depot.  This worked quite well, since I could stretch the sandpaper and slightly rock back and forth to dial in the shape I was looking for.

### Box Lid
--------------

For the box lid, I designed a frame made using bridle joints and opted for a floating panel in the middle, to allow for wood movement.  Bridle joints were chosen for the frame of the lid because it allowed me to give the top a similar proud and rounded profile that the finger joints of the actual box had, which helped to unify the look of the box.

In order to cut the grooves in the frame to accept the lid panel, I used a tongue and groove router bit set on my [Homemade Router Table](/shopbuilds/router_table).  I actually only used the groove bit and cut the tongue for the panel on the table saw.  At any rate, using the router table made this process quite easy, with the only downside being that for the tenon portion of the bridle joint, I had a groove that did not extend as far as it needed to and was rounded.  To fix this issue, I simply used a handsaw to cut some kerfs and chiseled out the material.  This was a fairly quick process.  Once I did this, I then rounded over the exposed portions of the bridle joint in a similar fashion to the finger joints from before (I neglected to take any pictures during this portion of the build).

![Shaped Joints](/img/keepsake_box/shaped_joints.jpg "Shaped box and frame joints"){: .col .half .right}

When I was finished with the bridle joint frame, I transferred the measurements to a previously glued-up panel and trimmed the panel to size on my Miter Saw (at this point I had installed the dado stack on my table saw and didn't feel like replacing it with my usual blade...laziness strikes again!).  To cut the tongue for the panel, I transferred the size of the groove cut into the bridle joint frame and attached a stop block to my miter gauge.  I then could remove material to create the tongue on the panel.  Note that the width of the tongue is about 1/8" smaller than the depth of the groove on the panel joint to allow for wood movement.  This panel would be installed via friction fit only, and I used some small rubber balls (called "Spaceballs" if you want to [google](https://google.com) them) to prevent the panel from sliding around.

### Wenge Plugs
----------------

To assemble both the box and the frame, I used 1/4" dowels capped off with individually shaped Wenge plugs.  The first step here was to use my drill press to bore out a 1/4" hole in the bridle joints and on the face of the finger joints. For the inside portion of the finger joints, I just dry-assembled the box and used a block of wood with a hole drilled out to act as a guide for a cordless drill.  This little jig allowed me to maintain a straight hole to ensure the dowels would fit properly.  Actual installation of the dowels just involved putting some glue in the drilled holes as well as on the dowel and just hammering them in.  If the dowel was a bit proud of the surface, I just took a flush trim saw to cut it down to size.

![Drill press](/img/keepsake_box/drillpress.jpg "Boring holes for dowels"){: .col .half .right}

Making the plugs was a bit of a time sink, since each one needed to be individually shaped and cut.  First, I used a square mortise chisel (meant for mortising machines) to determine the size of the plugs.  The dimensions of the plug really don't matter, as it's purely aesthetic.  I went with a 3/8" square size, so I used a 3/8" square mortise chisel to set up my table saw fence.  I first ripped my piece of Wenge to 3/8" wide, and then turned the milled piece by ninety degrees to trim it to 3/8" square.

![Wenge Plug](/img/keepsake_box/single_plug.jpg "Single Wenge plug"){: .col .half .left}

To shape the plugs, I used a method that [Darrell Peart](http://furnituremaker.com) described in this [Popular Woodworking video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtFllmTpnl0).  It's a fairly straight-forward process.  I first attached three grits of sandpaper to a wooden block: 220, 400, and 1500.  I then take my 3/8" square piece of Wenge and swipe it across the 220 grit sandpaper in a shallow arc, followed by turning the peg by ninety degrees and swiping in a shallow arc once again.  I do this on each grit of sandpaper and then polish it on a soft rag charged up with some white polishing compound to give it a nice sheen.  Originally I started off by chucking the peg in my cordless drill to polish it, but ended up doing it by hand later on since it was just as efficient.

To cut the plugs, I made a simple jig to ensure a square cut *and* to cut a very tiny piece without it flying across the room (totally unrelated: do not use a table saw for this).  The jig is just a piece of scrap pine glued to a scrap piece of plywood.  I then took my saw and cut into the pine, registering the saw at a 90 degree angle using a square.  I could then take my Wenge pegs and cut off ~1/4" plug with relative ease.  I had to cut a total of 28 plugs using this method.

As a final note, I chamfered the bottom of each plug with my chisel in order to make the next step less painful.

### Plug Installation
----------------------

Installing the plugs first involved outlining a square mortise using the previously mentioned square mortise chisels.  Once these were marked, I used a 1/4" chisel to make an **X** pattern and then started carving out the plug mortise.  I used a vernier caliper to gauge the depth of the mortise and wanted to make sure I cut deep enough such that the plug didn't "bottom out".  This took a bit of trial and error, but after the first few plugs I was able to quickly knock these out.

![Progress Check](/img/keepsake_box/mineral_spirit_test.jpg "Color preview after wiping minearl spirits"){: .col .split .right}

One issue I ran into here happened when I used my hammer to pound the plugs into place.  For my first few plug mortises, I did not cut them *quite* wide enough, so more force was required to get the plugs in place.  At this point, the plugs were very difficult to remove so widening the hole just wasn't an option: I had to pound them in place.  As it turns out, I didn't need to use as much force as I thought...once I hammered the first time the plug not only fell into place, but sort of *caved in* creating a dimple in the plug.  Would most people notice this? Probably not, but *I* noticed it and wanted to fix it.  My solution was to carve the plug flush and try to shape it in place.  This resulted in a much tighter radius for the roundover (as opposed to the "cloud" profile I was after) but looked significantly better than the stupid dimple.  Luckily, I had only started installation of two or three plugs, so I was able to quickly rectify the installation issue and just faced that corner of the frame in the back :)

Once the plug installation was finished, I wiped on some mineral spirits to check for dried glue and other imperfections I could correct before finishing.  It also allowed me to see a preview of what the box would look like when finished (and I was pretty excited at this point!).

### Finishing
-------------

Ok, there technically was another step before finishing where I installed the hinges but I forgot to take photos or video.  Regardless, it wasn't that complicated: drill a hole the size of my barrel hinge, mark it on the lid, jam them in place and tighten the set screw.  It was my first time installing barrel hinges and it was *incredibly* easy, so you're not missing much.

![Color test](/img/keepsake_box/color_test.jpg "Checking the color between three different finishes"){: .col .half .left}

Onto finishing.  I wasn't entirely sure how I wanted to finish this box.  I narrowed my choices down to Boiled Linseed Oil, Danish Oil (oil/varnish blend), and a Wiping Varnish.  In the image on the left, I have Danish oil on top, the wiping varnish in the middle, and the BLO on bottom.  It's very hard to see the difference in the photo and only marginally easier in person.  The wiping varnish was quite glossy and off-putting, so I nixed it right away.  The BLO gave a slightly flatter sheen than the Danish oil which I didn't like as much, so I decided on Danish Oil.  Quite frankly, I think the difference was marginal at best and that my final results would've looked quite similar in either case.

To apply the finish, I just used some shop towels to apply a liberal amount on every surface.  After ten or fifteen minutes, I wiped off the excess and applied some more oil, again wiping off excess about fifteen minutes later.  I let the finish fully cure for almost a week because I had intended to finish it with wax...but I like how it looked without the wax so I just left it as is.  I gave the whole surface a very light sanding with 1500 grit sandpaper which create a very nice surface to touch.
