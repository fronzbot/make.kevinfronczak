I was asked to build a wedding card box for my sister's wedding, so I decided to overcomplicate it.  I have been fascinated by Greene and Greene style furniture and figured that it would be a really fun and challenging idea to design and build a wedding card box in that iconic style.  I have some [free plans](/plans/greene_and_greene_box) available for those who may be interested in tackling this project.

### Milling Lumber
------------------

To start, I chose Sapele for my box material and Wenge as the square plugs.  Traditionally, the Greene brothers used Ebony for their plugs but Ebony is *so damn expensive* so I went with the cheaper (yet still pricey) Wenge.  I first roughly marked out my cuts using some chalk so I could more easily visualize the different grain patterns and how they may look with the assembled piece.  I bought almost exactly the board-footage of wood I needed for the project, so taking my time here was important.

### Panels and Finger Joints
-----------------------------

Since I needed to glue up panels for the walls of the box, I wanted to make sure the edges of my board were square.  I don't have a jointer, so to do this I used my previously built [table saw jointing jig](/shopbuilds/tapering_jig).  I first jointed one edge and then used this edge to register against my table saw fence for the rip cuts.  When I was finished with that, I began the glue-up of the wall panels.

The next day, I removed the clamps from the panels and cleaned them up with my Smoothing Plane and a card scraper.  Sapele has some tight interlocked grain which makes it *very* difficult to avoid tearout while planing...which I learned the hard way.  Luckily most of the tearout I had was pretty shallow and easily cleaned up with the card scraper.  Any deep gouges I had ended up being used as the inside of the box, so no one really sees it...

Before moving onto cutting the finger joints, I needed to trim the wall panels to their final dimensions.  To do this, I used my previously built [crosscut sled](/shopbuilds/crosscut_sled).  I am using a 40-tooth thin-kerf general purpose blade here, which gives me a very clean cut.

I really didn't feel like installing a dado stack for the finger joints, so I just hogged out material one kerf at a time.  The way I designed this box allowed me to setup one stop on my miter gauge's sacrificial fence.  I first carefully align the start of the cut by eye, and make my cut.  I then move the piece to the stop block and make a second cut.  After that, I simply move the piece horizontally until I've taken all of the material out.  Once the first finger joint dado is cut, I flip the panel and do the second dado.

![Box joints dry fit](/img/keepsake_box/finger_joint_dry_fit.jpg "Dry fit of finger joints"){: .col .half .right}

Once the front and back panels are finished, I have to carefully mark these joints on the side panels.  I then cut these joints in a similar fashion to the front and rear panels.  The dry fit ended up being a tad looser than I would've liked, but there were no visual gaps.  As a note, each finger is proud of the surface by around 1/8" so that I can round them a bit.  This type of styling is an iconic part of Greene & Greene furniture.

### Waterfall Lifts
------------------

The next step was to cut the waterfall lifts in the bottom of the panels.  This little design element helps make the box stand out a bit and, like the proud finger joints, is another nice Greene & Greene motif.  The process here is rather straight-forward.  Like the finger joints, I couldn't be bothered to install my dado stack so I just used my normal thin-kerf blade to hog out material.  I didn't have to be perfect here, so I just eye-balled the start and stop points of the "steps".

To shape the lifts, I eve-balled an angle that looked nice to me and used my sliding bevel gauge to lock that angle in.  I transferred this angle to each of the steps on every panel.  To cut these angles, I just used my dovetail saw and cleaned it up a bit with my card scraper.  
The next step was to shape the lifts to give them a soft roundover profile.  I did most of the shaping with a coarse rasp and followed it with some 220 and 320 grit sandpaper.  It's worth pointing out that the 320 grit sandpaper I used was a flexible material made by 3M that I found at Home Depot.  This worked quite well, since I could stretch the sandpaper and slightly rock back and forth to dial in the shape I was looking for.
