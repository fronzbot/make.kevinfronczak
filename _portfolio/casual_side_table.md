The second furniture piece I built as part of Steve Ramsey's [Weekend Woodworker](https://theweekendwoodworker.com) course was this side table.  The original design was a bit different, with a higher shelf and mitered edges for the top slats.  I wanted to modify it to better fit with furniture in our house, as my wife and I wanted to use this as a side table in our living room.

This project marked the first time I used Minwax's Early American stain on a project.  Up to this point, my wife was very hesitant about lighter stains, claiming she hated the look.  I decided to try and change her mind by using this stain and I succeeded.  This color is definitely my favorite stain to use if I'm working with pine.

This table provided another first for me: using lacquer.  I used spray can lacquer, which was a mistake because of how big this project is (I used three cans...).  The primary reason I went with lacquer, though, was the fact that it is an evaporative finish which was perfect for the below-freezing February weather in Rochester, NY.  Dry times were a bit long, but I was able to put around six coats over three days.  I'd apply a coat in the morning before work, and then when I got home.

The above image also shows a slight design change I made to the bottom shelf (compared to Steve's original plans).  Instead of insetting the slats for the shelf (so they are flush with the trim) I placed them on top.  I just thought it looked more...rustic?  Not sure how to describe the look, but regardless I liked it.

Again, the finished product:
