This bench was the first piece of furniture I built as part of Steve Ramsey's [Weekend Woodworker](https://theweekendwoodworker.com) course.  In fact, it's the primary reason I signed up for the course because my wife really wanted an entry way bench and we both liked the design.  Plus, once I saw some of the other projects in the course I started to mentally place them in areas around my house so I was really looking forward to making all (or most) of the pieces.

I made all of the cuts on my miter saw (which I purchased a few weeks prior to this build) and that helped make the initial build process go by pretty quickly.  I chamfered the feet to make the legs look less wonky when sitting on the ground (a perfectly square leg just looks weird).  The stain I use was Minwax Red Chesnut, and I really liked the look of it (i wasn't too sure how it would turn out).

For the finish, I used a water-based polyurethane.  The reason for this is that I made this bench in January in the Northeast US... so it was really cold outside.  The stain cured after awhile outdoors, but i didn't want to mess with an oil-based finish with the below-freezing temps.  A water-based finish would allow me to apply it in my basement shop, since there are no harmful chemicals associated with it.  The downside, is I had to be *absolutely* sure the stain was cured since oil and water don't mix.  To test this, I dampened a rag with mineral spirits and ran it across the piece to see if any stain came off.  If some did, I needed to wait longer.

Once the stain was cured, I applied the poly (around 3-4 coats).  In between each coat, I cgave it a light sanding with 220 grit sandpaper.
