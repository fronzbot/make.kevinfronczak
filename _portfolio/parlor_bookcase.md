This was built as part of Steve Ramsey's [Weekend Woodworker](https://theweekendwoodworker.com) course.  This project caused me to cave and finally buy a table saw because ripping boards with my circular saw was just slowing me down.  This plays into my philosophy of only buying what you *need* and not immediately splurging for the most expensive tools you can find.  My circular saw reliance was causing me to be inefficient, and a table saw would immediately fix this inefficieny.  And boy do I wish I bought one sooner.

The bookcase was built with a mix of pine (for trim) and baltic birch plywood.  The decorative trim utilized mitered corners and a decorative chamfer.

One mistake I made during the build process was when I was drilling the holes for the shelf pins.  The tape I had on my drill bit to mark my depth slipped, and I ended up punching through the frame.  The fix this, I cut some 1/4" plywood I had lying around and shaped it with sandpaper to form a circular plug.  It's very noticeable in this picture, but after staining and finishing it's impossible to see unless you are specifically looking for it.


The stain I used was one of my favorites: Minwax Early American.

For finish, I used a glossy brushing lacquer.  I applied a few coats, and once the final coat was applied I began the buffing process.  First I sanded with 320 grit sandpaper.  After that I used 0000 steel wool with soapy water (acting as a lubricant) to bring the finish up to a satin.  The end result was awesome: a beautifully smooth finish.
