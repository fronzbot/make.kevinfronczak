This was the first real piece of furniture I've made.  The plans were a slighlty modified version of [these](http://www.ana-white.com/2011/01/farmhouse-bedside-table) from [Ana White](http://www.ana-white.com), which means cheap lumber and pocket holes.  For my first project, this was perfect as it was obviously a learning experience and getting hung up on advanced joinery wasn't something I really needed to concern myself with.  The design was "wife-approved" but one major flaw is that nothing in this design accounts for wood movement.  Seasonal changes in humidity will cause the wood to warp and can destabilize the whole thing.  I'll show an example of this at the end.


Again, the frame is held together with glue and pocket-hole screws, but this meant it was very easy and quick to assemble.  At this point, my only realy tool to use was a circular saw, so my cuts weren't perfect and certainly not square.

For the stain, I used a mix of Minwax Red Oak and Minwax Special Walnut in a ratio of about 1:1.  I was attempting to match the color of furniture in my bedroom and got close enough with that.  My wife approved, anyhow.

For the finish, I used an oil-based Polyurethane, primarily because that's a finish I've used before and I was comfortable with it.  I picked out a satin version to use and applied around three coats, sanding with 220 grit in between coats.

Once the finish was dry, I could install the drawer hardware.  I went with a brushed nickel set.

And again, the final product in its final resting place:

As I mentioned, this design does not concern itself with wood movement at all, so I did make an effort to be careful with how I assembled the top.  I made sure to alternate the grain so that I had something like a "smiley face, frowny face, smiley face" so that any cupping gets averaged out to maintain a relatively flat top.  Good thing, because after only six months, the boards cupped heavily (note the panels weren't edge glued, so they seperated. Luckily this sort of adds to the rustic look, so now it's a design feature :D).

This project was a wonderful learning experience, and I highly recommend anyone getting started with woodworking to just make something.  You WILL make mistakes, and it won't be perfect, but it's the best way to learn and build your skills.
