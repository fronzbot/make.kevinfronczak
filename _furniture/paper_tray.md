As part of Steve Ramsey's [Weekend Woodworker](http://theweekendwoodworker.com) course, I built this *FANCY* paper tray.  Really, the intent was to build skills making rabbet joints and weird angled edges.  However, I had yet to purchase a table saw, so the rabbets I made with my plunge router and a temporary jig I installed onto my [workbench](/shopbuilds/bmw).

The tray itself is built out of red oak and finished with a few coats of spray lacquer.  Right now it serves as a junk collector, but it's better than junk all over our counters!
