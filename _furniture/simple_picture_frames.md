For mother's day 2018 I decided to make a simple picture frame for my wife (especially because it was her first mother's day).  The design was very simple and just used some 1x2 pine I already had.  I took a roman-ogee bit to carve out the profile, and bought some acrylic that I cut for the front panel.  The backing was made from 1/8" hardboard so, other than the mounting hardware, everything was handmade with this frame.

The stain used was Minwax Special Walnut, and I finished it with spray lacquer that I buffed to a satin finished with 0000 steel wool and soapy water.
